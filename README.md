## Installation

OS X & Linux:

```sh
npm install
```

## Testing

Snapshot testing is done with Jest.  Jest ships with React but if you don't have it installed for some reason you can run this script:

```sh
npm install --save-dev jest babel-jest babel-preset-env babel-preset-react react-test-renderer
```

Install Babel dependecies to use with Jest

```sh
npm install --save-dev babel-jest babel-core
```

### Unique Dependecies

* youtube-api-search - Used to pull data from YouTube.

### Challenges and Solutions

Here are some of challenges I encountered along the way and how I went about solving them.

### Code Snippets

### Acknowledgements

Stephen Grider, thank you for your course.  It was a great way to take my React knowledge to the next level.
